# metabolisis (n.)

*/ˌmeh-tə-BOL-uh-sis/*

A dynamic, reciprocal exchange of energy and matter through which an entity and its environment mutually transform and co-evolve via sustained dialogue.

*A dance of becoming, where giving and receiving are inseparable acts of creation.*

*"We are the universe in metabolisis - stardust learning to breathe itself anew."*


## In biology:

A systemic network of biochemical interactions through which organisms *and* their ecosystems adaptively reshape one another. Distinct from passive metabolism, metabolisis emphasizes a bidirectional flow of resources and information, where cellular processes (e.g., photosynthesis, symbiosis) simultaneously alter the organism's internal state and the external conditions sustaining it in real time.

*(Example: Mycorrhizal fungi thread through forest roots, trading nitrogen for sugar - a silent pact in which trees and fungi rewrite each other's survival, molecule by molecule.)*


## In philosophy:

The ontological imperative of *becoming-through-exchange*: existence as a participatory dialogue between self and world. Rejects static being in favor of fluid co-creation - identity emerges not from isolation, but through friction and fusion at boundaries (e.g., breath as air becoming self; self becoming soil).

*(Example: A conversation where words are not merely traded but metabolized - each sentence altering speaker, listener, and the relational space between. In time, all three may become unrecognizable to their original selves.)*


## Etymology:

From Greek *meta-* (μετα-, "change, beyond") + *ballein* (βάλλειν, "to throw, cast") + *-ōsis* (-ωσις, "process").

- Distinguished from *metabolism* (routine biochemical maintenance) by emphasizing adaptive, reciprocal transformation.
- *Note:* While *-ōsis* often denotes pathology (e.g., *neurosis*), here it reclaims its broader Greek sense of *process* - a neutral, ongoing state of flux. Compare: symbiosis (*sýn-* + *biōsis*), a process of living together.


## Related terms:

To clarify usage and conceptual boundaries:

- **Metabolisis** *(+exchange, +transformation)*: See definition above.
- **Autobolisis** *(+exchange, -transformation)*: Interaction without mutual adaptation; transactional exchange that leaves both parties unchanged.
- **Metamorphosis** *(-exchange, +transformation)*: Transformation understood in isolation; a change in form or structure occurring independently of external exchange.
- **Stasis** *(-exchange, -transformation)*: Neither exchange nor transformation occurs; systemic inactivity, equilibrium, or suspended dynamism.
